# Class Notes: Introduction to Terraform

## 🌱 Started Learning Terraform

- Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp.
- It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.

## 📚 Terraform Registry

- Terraform Registry is a central repository for finding and sharing Terraform modules.
- It contains a collection of pre-built configurations for various infrastructure components that can be easily reused.

## 🧐 How to Do Google Search

- Using Google search effectively can help in finding solutions to Terraform-related problems.
- It's important to use specific keywords related to the issue to get relevant results.

## 🛠️ Creating a Resource Group

- Demonstrated how to create a resource group using different tools:
  1. Notepad: Manually writing Terraform configuration files.
  2. File Explorer: Running Terraform commands from the command line.
  3. Command Line: Using the Terraform CLI to create a resource group.
- Observed that using multiple windows for these tasks can be cumbersome.

## 🚀 Exploring Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

- Explored VSCode as an integrated development environment (IDE) for Terraform.
- Created a resource group using Terraform in VSCode, which provides a more streamlined and efficient workflow compared to using multiple windows.
