## Topic 1: Azure CLI Commands üíª

### 1.1 Understanding Azure CLI Command Structure:

- Azure CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a command-line tool provided by Microsoft for managing Azure resources.
- Commands follow a structured format: `az [group] [subgroup] [action] [parameters]`.

### 1.2 Decoding `az group create` Command:

- We discussed the `az group create` command which is used to create a resource group in Azure.
- `--name` flag specifies the name of the resource group (`demoResourceGroup` in our example).
- `--location` flag specifies the Azure region where the resource group will be located (`westus` in our example).

### 1.3 Creating Azure CLI Commands using `--help`:

- The `--help` option provides detailed information about the command, its subcommands, and available parameters.
- It's a valuable resource for understanding command syntax, usage, and available options.
