# Assignment 1: Setting up Terraform Remote Backend

## Task 1: Manual Setup
- **Objective:** Create a resource group, a storage account, and a container for Terraform backend manually in Azure Portal.

## Steps:
1. **Resource Group Creation:**
   - Login to Azure Portal.
   - Navigate to Resource Groups.
   - Click on "Create Resource Group".
   - Enter a name and select a region.
   - Click on "Review + Create" and then "Create" to create the resource group.

2. **Storage Account Creation:**
   - Inside the created resource group, click on "Add" to add a new resource.
   - Search for "Storage account" and select it.
   - Click on "Create".
   - Enter the required details like name, region, etc.
   - Click on "Review + Create" and then "Create".

3. **Container Creation:**
   - Inside the created storage account, navigate to "Containers".
   - Click on "+ Container".
   - Enter a name for the container and select the access level (e.g., "Private").

## Task 2: Local Setup
- **Objective:** Configure Terraform to use the created storage account for backend.

## Steps:
1. **Create a New Folder:**
   - Create a new folder on your computer for your Terraform project.

2. **Create `main.tf` File:**
   - Inside the folder, create a `main.tf` file.
   - Copy the provider block from the Terraform Registry for Azure.

3. **Configure Backend:**
   - Copy the backend block configuration from the Terraform Registry for Azure Storage.
   - Modify the backend block to use the storage account and container created in Task 1.

## Task 3: Terraform Execution
- **Objective:** Write Terraform code to create two resource groups and validate the setup.

## Steps:
1. **Write Terraform Code:**
   - Inside `main.tf`, write Terraform code to create two resource groups.
   - Ensure you use the correct provider and backend configuration.

2. **Initialize Terraform:**
   - Open a terminal in the folder where `main.tf` is located.
   - Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform environment.

3. **Plan and Apply:**
   - Run `terraform plan` to see the execution plan.
   - If the plan looks good, run `terraform apply` to create the resource groups.

## Task 4: Validate State File
- **Objective:** Ensure the Terraform state file is stored in the Azure Storage Account.

### Submission
- Submit a document containing screenshots of the resource group, storage account, container, `main.tf` file, Terraform execution output (plan and apply), and the state file in the storage account container.

**Note:** Ensure that all resources created in this assignment are properly named and managed according to best practices.


# Assignment 2: Terraform Dependency Management

## Task 1: Setting Up Terraform
- **Objective:** Create a Terraform configuration for managing Azure resources.

## Steps:
1. **Create a New Folder:**
   - Create a new folder on your computer for your Terraform project.

2. **Create `main.tf` File:**
   - Inside the folder, create a `main.tf` file.
   - Copy the provider block from the Terraform Registry for Azure.

3. **Resource Group and Storage Account Configuration:**
   - Write Terraform code in `main.tf` to create one resource group and one storage account in Azure.

## Task 2: Terraform Execution
- **Objective:** Initialize Terraform, create an execution plan, and apply the changes.

## Steps:
1. **Initialize Terraform:**
   - Open a terminal in the folder where `main.tf` is located.
   - Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform environment.

2. **Plan and Apply:**
   - Run `terraform plan` to create an execution plan.
   - If the plan looks good, run `terraform apply` to create the resource group and storage account.

## Task 3: Dependency Error Analysis
- **Objective:** Understand and resolve dependency-related errors in Terraform.

## Steps:
1. **Identify Error:**
   - Review the output of `terraform apply` to identify any dependency-related errors.

2. **Analyze Error:**
   - Look for error messages indicating dependency issues, such as resources being created out of order or dependencies not correctly defined.

### Submission
- Submit a document containing the `main.tf` file, screenshots of the Terraform initialization, planning, and apply stages, and any error messages related to dependency issues.

---

**Note:** Pay close attention to the error messages and ensure that dependencies between resources are correctly defined in your Terraform configuration.
