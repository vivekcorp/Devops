   - Use Azure CLI to delete the "CLIResourceGroup" created earlier.

4. **Create a New Resource Group and Storage Account in that RG using Manual Method and Azure CLI:**
   - Manually create a new resource group named "StorageRG" through the Azure Portal.
   - Inside "StorageRG", manually create a new storage account named "ManualStorageAccount".
   - Use Azure CLI to create a new resource group named "CLIStorageRG" and within it, create a storage account named "CLIStorageAccount".

5. **Delete the Storage Account using Manual Method and Azure CLI:**
   - Delete the "ManualStorageAccount" manually through the Azure Portal.
   - Use Azure CLI to delete the "CLIStorageAccount" created earlier.

## Submission Guidelines:
