### 🚀 Terraform and Azure Adventure Assignment 🌍

#### Part 1: 🎨 Manually Create a Resource Group (RG) in Azure Portal

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. In the left-hand navigation pane, select "Resource groups."
3. Click on the "➕ Add" button to create a new resource group.
4. Enter a name for the resource group and select a region.
5. Click on the "Review + create" button, review the details, and click on "Create" to create the resource group.
6. Take note of the arguments required for creating the resource group, such as name and location.

#### Part 2: 🛠️ Create a Resource Group Using Terraform

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new folder and open it in VSCode or any other editor.
3. Create a new `.tf` file with any name.
4. Search for "terraform azure resource group" on Google to find the Terraform Registry link for `azurerm_resource_group`. Open that link.
5. Copy the provider code from the page and paste it into the `.tf` file.
6. Copy the example code for the resource group from the Terraform Registry page and paste it into the `.tf` file.
7. Run the following Terraform commands and observe the output for each command:
   - `terraform init`: Initialize the Terraform configuration.
   - `terraform validate`: Validate the Terraform configuration.
   - `terraform fmt`: Format the Terraform configuration.
   - `terraform plan`: Generate and show an execution plan.
   - `terraform apply`: Apply the Terraform configuration to create the resource group in Azure.
8. Add two more resource group blocks in the `.tf` file, each with a different name and location.
9. Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` again to see how Terraform creates the two new resource groups.
10. Remove one resource group block from the `.tf` file.
11. Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` again to see how Terraform removes that resource group from Azure after applying the changes.
